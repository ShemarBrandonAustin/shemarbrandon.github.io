				<h3 class="projecthead">My First Character Attempt</h3>
				<div class="projectscreen">
					<img src="images/charscreenone.png" alt="">
				</div>
				<p>This was my first attempt at creating a character. It was a cowboy with no name. The reference image that was being used was provided by the person who was teaching me this (Whose name i cant remember). The way he made it was by resizing shapes (mainly a cube) to fit the length and width of the character. While his method could have worked fine it would only work for low level renders and that would be it. Since i planned to use these character to animate one day this was not an ideal method for me to use for modelling a character.</p>

				<h3 class="projecthead">My Attempt at creating a Character Head</h3>
				<div class="projectscreen">
					<img src="images/charscreentwo.png" alt="">
				</div>
				<p>This was my attempt at creating a Head. This is a long and painstaking process especially for beginners and there aren't enough tutorials out there to teach you. The Photo above shows how far i got with making a face on my own which is complicated in its own right but making the head might be so much harder. Not to mention to make a face that can animate you need to make it according to muscles in a real human face to create accurate speech patterns.</p>

				<h3 class="projecthead">My Attempt at creating a Character Body</h3>
				<div class="projectscreen">
					<img src="images/charscreenthree.png" alt="">
				</div>
				<p>There were many ways of going about doing this but maybe the best i've found is by reshpaing a cylinder to fit the reference body. This works better with female bodies with more curves. To make this compatible for animation as well is a long process but it is probably the easiest (This includes making hands and toes and even clothes). This is one of the first things i learnt to make for character modelling and although i do not have my original shots of the process this is one i never completeed. </p>

				<h3 class="projecthead">Creating a Make-Shift Studio</h3>
				<div class="projectscreen">
					<img src="images/studioscreen.png" alt="">
				</div>
				<p>Renders only look realisitc if they have everything a real world would have and one of these things are backgrounds. This attempt at a "Studio" was made so i have a place to put finished projects and render them to make them look as if they had their photo taken in a real life studio room. This project went incompleted because HDRs came into the mix. With HDRs i would no longer have to make an entire bacground or even do lighting HDRs do all of that buy taking real world pictures 360&deg; and placing them into the render to take its lightsource and background</p>

				</div>
				<p>Before making this website for Problem Set One i attempted to make it in gravit to see how it would look before hand. I'm a fan of black and white and so that is what i used for both the prototype (Which i decided not to use) and this website i am using</p>

				<p>This is bob my the first character i tried to make in gravit. Making characters is one of the reasons i picked up on gravit and althought this is just a face it is somthing. (Alice is on The way üòÅüòÅ)</p>
